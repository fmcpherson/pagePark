				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://covidactnow.org/us/michigan-mi/county/oakland_county/?s=32582081&quot;&gt;Covid ActNow&lt;/a&gt; is the site I use to track COVID data for my county and state and they recently transitioned from highlighting transmission rates like daily new cases per 100k, infection rate R(0), and positive test rate to community level metrics: weekly new cases per 100k, weekly COVID hospital admissions per 100k, percent of patients in hospital beds. The metrics align to the what the CDC is emphasizing and communicating and is a transition from focusing on spread to focusing on consequences of infection. In theory, assuming that COVID will always be with us what we are more concerned is about how many people get severe illness. I imagine this is similar to how the yearly flu is tracked. What is not clear to me is how should one react when the numbers track up in to the higher categories?" created="Wed, 20 Apr 2022 17:54:10 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Currently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://covidactnow.org/us/michigan-mi/county/oakland_county/?s=28151700&quot;&gt;66.5% of the residents in my county&lt;/a&gt; are fully vaccinated (69.6% one shot plus), which is a little better than the 60.4% for &lt;a href=&quot;https://covidactnow.org/us/michigan-mi/?s=34402239&quot;&gt;the entire state&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="One reason to monitor new cases is the relationship between the rate of new cases and the risk of new mutations. As long as the virus spreads out of control the higher the probability of new mutations that the current vaccines don't prevent. It looks like we might have years of spring and late fall/winter outbreaks." created="Fri, 30 Apr 2021 13:16:06 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Given that it is likely we will be living with COVID-19 for many years I am expecting there will be a yearly COVID vaccine like there is for the flu. We also need to keep an eye on treatments, the more options available to doctors the better. Pfizer has developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizers-novel-covid-19-oral-antiviral-treatment-candidate&quot;&gt;an antiviral pill&lt;/a&gt; to treat COVID-19 and is seeking FDA emergency approval.

					<outline text="It appears the main concern in the United States is not that Omicron will lead to a significant increase in deaths but that it will significantly increase hospitalizations, which has corresponding consequences. The reason for the concern is the percent of the population who have not had three shots. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/omicron-coronavirus-cases-europe-us-c85be94d-8edf-4d61-9f05-de924bff6760.html&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;" created="Tue, 14 Dec 2021 13:51:33 GMT"/>

				<outline text="“I believe it is impossible to overstate the defining nature of the empire of force among us, if empire is understood as a political, economic, military, ideological practice of self-security and control. It is not clear that life can be construed beyond empire; but the poets have to try. The poets, because they are poets, never arrive there, for their poetry would then become program. That, however, does not render the poetry as a failure or as an irrelevance. It only affirms that alternatives to the lethal reductionism of empire require imagination and courage and staying power. In that ancient world, it was required that old Jerusalem be relinquished and new Jerusalem be undertaken. It is no less required now that there be relinquishing and undertaking.”" created="Thu, 02 Feb 2023 21:35:44 GMT"/>
