					<outline text="I am surprised that the 4a feels to be as heavy as the Pixel 2. Because it has a plastic case, I expected the 4a to feel lighter. I guess the weight is due to having a larger battery, which is a good trade-off." created="Sat, 29 Aug 2020 18:06:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Battery discharge rate with screen off per AccuBattery Pro is at 2%, which is considerably better than the Pixel 2 which gets 3.5% at best.

" created="Sat, 29 Aug 2020 18:12:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I bought the Google fabric case and put it on for a day but took it off as I think it adds a little too much bulk. Besides, there is something pleasing  with how the naked Pixel 4a feels in my hand.

					<outline text="I am finding that physical size of the Pixel 4a is perfect for me. What I am surprised by is what a difference it makes for the 4a to be slightly narrower than the Pixel 2. I don't think I want a screen larger than the 5.81 inch screen in the 4a. I grudgingly carried the Nexus 6P, which was huge, for the sake of having a pure Android phone, and I really don't want to go back to that.

					<outline text="I recently bought the Apple Magic Keyboard for the iPad and am really happy with the combination of it and  the iPad Air. I do think that if I had to, I could use this combination as my only personal computer. It may seem like a small thing, but what makes the difference for me is the ability to easily remove the iPad from the case so that I can quickly transition from landscape laptop mode to portrait tablet mode. The magnets make all the difference." created="Thu, 17 Dec 2020 16:41:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I've discovered that the Yubikey 5C does not work with the iPad Air 4, which I find odd.
