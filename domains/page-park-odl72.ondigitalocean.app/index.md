Hello world! This is an instance of [pagePark](https://github.com/scripting/pagePark) running on [Digital Ocean's app platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/). I have set this site up as an experiment to see how easy it is to deploy pagePark, which is a Nodejs app, using app platform. 

Prerequisites:

- An account with Digital Ocean
- An account on Github
- Fork a copy of the source repo to your Github account
- Clone the repo in your personal Github account to a personal computer
- Add package-lock.json to local repo
- Add config.json to local repo
- Mkdir domains in local repo
- Add a readme.txt file in domaisn directory of local repo
- git add .; git commit; git push

At this point you have a repo in your personal Github account that will be the source for your deployment of pagePark on the Digital Ocean
App Platform. Follow the steps provided to you by Digital Ocean to deploy the app. In this example I simply used the defaults and 
selected the smallest Basic container.
